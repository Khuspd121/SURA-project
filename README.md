# SURA-project
This project focuses on the design and fabrication of Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) under the guidance of Prof. Kedar Khare at the Optics & Physics Center, IIT Delhi. An advanced iterative algorithm was developed based on the Iterative Fourier Transform Algorithm (IFTA) to create multi-level DOE phase profiles. Optimization techniques, including gradient descent and the Adam optimizer, were employed to refine the designs and achieve optimal solutions. The phase profiles were quantized to two levels and tested on a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM), and a GDS file was generated on Ledit for UV lithography fabrication
